Building a secure and efficient solution for Product Verification
Across various domains, counterfeit products pose significant challenges for sellers and buyers alike. The issue of counterfeiting extends beyond just luxury goods; it impacts sectors ranging from pharmaceuticals and electronics to automotive parts and software. The proliferation of counterfeit products not only undermines the integrity of brands but also jeopardizes consumer safety, disrupts market competition, and leads to economic losses.

We are proposing a solution that utilizes blockchain and cryptography for companies that register with us. We generate public and private key pairs for the products they are selling, which are then printed as QR codes. The public key is applied to the product packaging, while the private key is securely placed inside the packaging.

When purchasing the product, users can scan the public key QR code to verify if the product is legitimate. If the product is verified as legitimate, the user can then open the packaging and scan the private key QR code to claim the product and access additional after-sales services.
